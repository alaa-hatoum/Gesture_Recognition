# Gesture_Recognition
Recognizes how bent the individual fingers in hand are and sends code to an arduino controller to make a mechanical hand copy gestures made through a camera. The controls folder is the arduino code which controls the acutation of the servo motors in the hand. The cv_backend code is used on the raspberry pi to take in the image and process the hand gestures.
